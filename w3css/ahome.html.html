    <h4> Marriages are made in heaven</h4>
    <p>
On my Wedding Day, I was scared a lot mainly I need to leave my father's hand and now I have to hold Karthik's hand.
        Surname my identity is changing, No more my home is going to be mine. Many questions but no answer.
        Everyone in the Hall are happy expect me. My brother was enjoying my wedding. Everyone are welcoming the relatives.
        Then ritual started
        KANYADANAM:
        All my Mama's came to carry me to the mandap in a bamboo basket, Till that time Me and Karthik should not see each other. In the kanyadanam,
        the My parents wash the feet of the Karthik, as the groom is considered as the Vishnu Murthy in the wedding.
        JEELAKARRA BELLAMJEELAKARRA :
        It is a signifies of union/marriage of the bride and the groom.
        Jeelakarra (cumin) and bellam (jaggery) are made into a thick paste and put on a betel leaf.
        Me and Karthik put it on each other’s head and saw him with smile.
        MANGALASUTRAM:
        This time Karthik ties three knots of the mangalasutram to me.
        It represent the mental, physical and spiritual union of their togetherness. All the people in the hall gave us blessings.
        TALAMBRALU:
        Now We move on to the fun and more happiness part of the wedding, It is a competition between me and karthik.
        Me and Karthik started shower each other’s heads with talambralu (pearls, or rice coloured by turmeric paste etc).
        SAPTAPADI:
        Karthik  dhoti is tied in a knot to one end of the My saree, and we started walk together around the homam (fire) seven times.
        Me and Karthik gave promises togetherness with every round around the homam.
        ARUNDHATI NAKSHATRAM:
        Karthik show's Me a star and saying it as Arundhati Nakshatram.
        APPAGINTHALU:
        Now, All my Joy turned into tear's .
        My father hug me and told I will be with you will me till his last breath and asked me to stop crying.
        I cried for a hour Karthik and my Brother are asking me to stop but I am not listening to him.
